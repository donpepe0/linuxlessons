## Lesson Content

Gee I wish some of these programs had a manual so we can see some more information about them. Well luckily they do! Aptly named man pages, you can see the manuals for a command with the man command. 

```$ man ls```

Man pages are manuals that are by default built into most Linux operating systems. They provide documentation about commands and other aspects of the system. 

Try it out on a few commands to get more information about them.

## Exercise

Run the man command on the ls command.
