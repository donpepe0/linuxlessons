## Lesson Content

The `tr` (translate) command allows you to translate a set of characters into another set of characters. Let's try an example of translating all lower case characters to uppercase characters. 

```
$ tr a-z A-Z
hello
HELLO
```

As you can see we made the ranges of a-z into A-Z and all text we type that is lowercase gets uppercased. 

## Exercise

Try the following command what happens? 

```
$ tr -d ello
hello
```
