## Lesson Content

If you get a couple of diehard Linux users in a room and ask them what is the best text editor to use, you'll hear a never ending banter about the godliness of either `Vim` or `Emacs`. Don't even try to bring up using a GUI editor if you value your life. 

`Vim` and `Emacs` are popular text editors that are installed by default on most Linux distributions and they both have their pros and cons. If you want to get around your system like a ninja, you'll need to pick up one of these text editors to use. They are essentially coding, word document processing and basically all in one editors.
