## Lesson Content

In a lot (if not all) of Emacs documentation, you will see the syntax `C-[letter]`. This just means hit the `Ctrl-letter`, but for shorthand purposes, we'll call `Ctrl with C`. If you see syntax such as `M-[letter]`, that means use the `Meta key`, most commonly the `Alt key`.

**Saving files**  

```
C-x C-s - Save a file
C-x C-w - Save file as
C-x s - Save all
```

The save file options will prompt you if you want to save each file.

**Opening a file**  

```
C-x C-f
```

This will prompt you to type a filename to open. If you do not have a file that already exists, it will create a new file. You can load up a directory as well.

## Exercise

Play around with opening files and saving files.
