## Lesson Content

To move around buffers (or files you're visiting) use the following commands:

**Switch buffers**  

```
C-x b - switch buffer
C-x right arrow - right-cycle through buffer
C-x left arrow - left-cycle through buffer
```

**Close the buffer**  

`C-x k`

**Split the current buffer**  

`C-x 2`

This allows you see multiple buffers on one screen. To move between these buffers use: `C-x o`

**Set a single buffer as the current screen**  

`C-x 1`

If you ever used a terminal multiplexer like screen and tmux, the buffer commands will feel very familiar.
